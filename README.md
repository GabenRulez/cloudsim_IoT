# A renewable energy extention of Cloudsim Simulator #

This fork introduces usage of energy from **photovoltaic farms** to the Cloudsim Simulator.
User can import data from **BSRN database**, define the parameters of a farm and create their own examples.

# Introduced classes #
* *BSRNDataLoader* - parses data from BSRN datasets
* *PhotovoltaicFarm* - contains specifics of a photovoltaic farm
* *RenewableEnergySource* - computes energy based on data from *BSRNDataLoader* and *PhotovoltaicFarm*

# Modified #
* *PowerDataCenter* now keeps track of renewable energy usage

# Running examples #
Some existing examples were changed and now include the usage of renewable energy. They can be found in **cloudsim-examples**.

Example plot generated from **Dvfs** example, based on station Budapest data (2020-07). Plot illustrates total energy used by data center (blue line) and energy from renewable sources (orange line).
